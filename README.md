General flow of program
  The program begins by asking the user to select one of three different options. Depending on the option chosen, the program then asks the user to input either a stock ticker or to enter a price of a stock. If option 3 is chosen, the program tells the user "goodbye" and the program ends. If the user selects either the stock ticker or price of the stock, the program reads from a file. The program then compares user choices to the file and outputs the appropriate response.
